quickstart,0,"bor(band(keyword(""quick""), keyword(""start"")), keyword(""quickstart""))",,"The easiest way is to install StarChat using two docker images. You only need:

* sbt
* docker
* docker compose

In this way, you will put all the indices in the Elasticsearch (version 5.3) image, and StarChat itself in the Java (8) image.

If you do not use docker you therefore need on your machine:

* Scala 12.2
* Elasticsearch 5.3

Just type “docker install” or “standalone install” to go on.
